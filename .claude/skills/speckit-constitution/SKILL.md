name: speckit-constitution
description: Create or update this project's engineering constitution (.specify/memory/constitution.md) - the non-negotiable principles that govern every spec, plan, and task. Use when asked to define, draft, amend, or ratify project principles, values, or governance, or to begin spec-driven development on the project. First phase of the SDD workflow; no prerequisites.

# Spec Kit — Constitution phase

## Preflight — run before anything else

You are in a **Claude Code cloud session**: all work stays on the **current git branch**. Never run `git checkout -b`, `git switch -c`, or `git branch`. The active feature is resolved from `.specify/feature.json` (override with `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`), never from the branch name.

1. Run `bash .specify/scripts/bash/preflight.sh` to print the active feature, which artifacts exist, and the next valid phase.
2. This is the first SDD phase and has **no prerequisite artifact**. If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is missing, seed it from `.specify/templates/constitution-template.md` first (never overwrite an existing constitution).

Do not proceed past this Preflight until the gate above is satisfied.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Scope Guard

This command's own work is limited to updating the project constitution itself. Dependent templates
and commands read the constitution at runtime and are not modified here.

- Classify every part of the user input as either constitution content or a separate,
  non-governance intent.
- If the input includes feature implementation, code generation, refactoring, building, or
  deployment requests, you **MUST NOT** execute them. Extract them as deferred intents instead.
- You **MUST NOT** create, modify, or delete application source files, feature routes,
  components, tests, deployment files, or other artifacts unrelated to the constitution
  workflow.
- If it is unclear whether an instruction is constitution content, ask for clarification before
  making changes.
- After completing the constitution update, include a `Next Actions` section for each deferred
  intent. List the original intent and suggest the appropriate follow-up Spec Kit command, such
  as `speckit-specify`, without invoking it.
- If there are no non-governance intents, omit the `Next Actions` section.

## Raise the current status quo with the user — do not silently encode it

Before finalizing any principle about code quality, tooling, or testing, **explicitly raise it
with the user and get a decision.** Do not encode the repository's current state as if it were
an intentional principle:

- Inspect the repo to learn what actually exists — configured linters/formatters (e.g. ruff,
  flake8, black, mypy, eslint, prettier), the test framework and how tests are run, type
  checking, CI gates, and any inconsistency between parts of the codebase.
- Where a principle would either mandate tooling that isn't set up, or bless the *absence* of
  tooling, surface it as an **open decision** in the conversation. Ask the user whether the
  constitution should require it (and which tool), or explicitly accept its absence for now.
- Record the user's answer in the constitution, or as a deferred `TODO(...)` item, rather than
  guessing. Never write a "code quality" principle that quietly assumes the current state is
  deliberate.

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values and (b) fill the template precisely.

**Note**: If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` does not exist yet, it should have been initialized from `.specify/templates/constitution-template.md` during project setup. If it's missing, copy the template first.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

5. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

6. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

7. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any TODO placeholders or deferred items requiring manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).
   - A `Next Actions` section for any deferred non-governance intents.

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.
