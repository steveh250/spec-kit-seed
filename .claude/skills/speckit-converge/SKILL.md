name: speckit-converge
description: Assess the current codebase against the active feature's spec, plan, and tasks, then append any remaining unbuilt work to tasks.md so implement can finish it. Use when asked to reconcile the code with the spec, find what is left to build, or close the gap to done. Requires plan.md and tasks.md.

# Spec Kit — Converge phase

## Preflight — run before anything else

You are in a **Claude Code cloud session**: all work stays on the **current git branch**. Never run `git checkout -b`, `git switch -c`, or `git branch`. The active feature is resolved from `.specify/feature.json` (override with `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`), never from the branch name.

1. Run `bash .specify/scripts/bash/preflight.sh` to print the active feature, which artifacts exist, and the next valid phase.
2. Gate on plan + tasks: `bash .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`. If it exits non-zero or prints an ERROR, **STOP** and run the named prerequisite skill (**speckit-specify** / **speckit-plan** / **speckit-tasks**) as directed. Converge is meant to run after **speckit-implement** has already run against the current `tasks.md`.

Do not proceed past this Preflight until the gate above is satisfied.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Close the gap between what a feature's specification, plan, and tasks call for and what the
codebase currently implements. Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` as the **sole
source of intent** (with the constitution as governing constraints), assess the current
state of the code, determine which requirements, acceptance criteria, plan decisions, and
existing tasks are unmet, incomplete, or only partially satisfied, and **append each piece
of remaining work as a new, traceable task** at the bottom of `tasks.md` so that
`speckit-implement` can complete it. This command MUST run only after
`speckit-implement` has run on the current `tasks.md`, and after `speckit-tasks` has produced a complete `tasks.md`.

This is **not** a diff tool and does **not** track changes. It assesses the present state
of the code relative to the feature's artifacts — no git, no branch comparison, no history.

## Operating Constraints

**APPEND-ONLY, NEVER REWRITE**: The command's **only** write is appending a new
`## Phase N: Convergence` section to `tasks.md`. It MUST NOT:

- modify `spec.md` or `plan.md` in any way;
- rewrite, renumber, reorder, or delete any existing task (including tasks from a prior
  Convergence phase);
- modify, create, or delete any application code — completing the appended tasks is the
  job of `speckit-implement`.

When the codebase already satisfies everything, the command MUST leave `tasks.md`
**byte-for-byte unchanged** (no empty Convergence header) and report a clean result.

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is
**non-negotiable**. Code that violates a MUST principle is the highest-severity finding and
produces a corresponding remediation task. If the constitution is an unfilled template,
skip constitution checks gracefully rather than failing.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Convergence Context

Run `bash .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md
- CONSTITUTION = `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (if present)
If `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or `tasks.md` is missing, STOP with a clear, actionable message naming the
prerequisite command to run (`speckit-specify` for a missing spec, `speckit-plan` for a missing plan,
`speckit-tasks` for missing tasks). Do not produce partial output.
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Functional Requirements (FR-###)
- Success Criteria (SC-###) — include only items requiring buildable work; exclude
  post-launch outcome metrics and business KPIs
- User Stories and their Acceptance Scenarios
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices and technical decisions
- Data Model references
- Phases and named touch-points (files/components the plan says will be created or edited)
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs (to compute the next ID and next phase number)
- Descriptions, phase grouping, and referenced file paths

**From constitution (if not an unfilled template):**

- Principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 3. Build the Intent Inventory

Create an internal model (do not echo raw artifacts):

- **Requirements inventory**: one stable key per FR-### / SC-### / user-story acceptance
  scenario (e.g. `US1/AC2`), plus the plan decisions and constitution principles that
  impose buildable obligations.
- **Code-scope map**: from the file paths named in `plan.md` and `tasks.md`, plus a keyword
  search for the concepts each requirement describes, derive the set of source files and
  components in scope for assessment. Bound the assessment to these — do **not** infer
  scope beyond what the artifacts define.

### 4. Assess the Codebase and Classify Findings

For each item in the intent inventory, inspect the current code in scope and produce a
`Finding` only where there is a gap. Classify every finding by **gap type**:

- **`missing`**: the required work is absent from the code entirely.
- **`partial`**: the work exists but does not yet fully satisfy the requirement /
  acceptance criterion / plan decision.
- **`contradicts`**: the code does something that conflicts with stated intent or a
  constitution MUST principle.
- **`unrequested`**: the code contains work not called for by the spec, plan, or tasks
  (surfaced for awareness — converge does **not** delete code, it only appends a task to
  review/justify or remove it).

Each `Finding` records: a stable id, the `source-ref` it traces to, the `gap-type`, a
severity, and a short human-readable description with the evidence (the file/area observed).

**Edge cases:**

- **Little or no code yet**: treat the entire specified scope as `missing` remaining work
  rather than failing.
- **Nothing remains**: produce zero findings and follow the converged branch in Step 7.

### 5. Assign Severity

- **CRITICAL**: violates a constitution MUST principle, or a `missing`/`contradicts` gap
  that blocks baseline functionality of a P1 user story.
- **HIGH**: a `missing` or `partial` gap on a core functional requirement or acceptance
  criterion.
- **MEDIUM**: a `partial` gap on a secondary requirement, or an `unrequested` addition with
  unclear justification.
- **LOW**: minor partial gaps, polish, or low-risk `unrequested` additions.

### 6. Present the In-Session Findings Summary

Before appending anything, output a compact, severity-graded summary (no file writes yet):

## Convergence Findings

| ID | Gap Type | Severity | Source | Evidence | Remaining Work |
|----|----------|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| F1 | missing  | HIGH     | FR-008 | Example: no append-only guard detected in path/to/module.py when writing tasks.md | Add append-only enforcement |

**Summary metrics:**

- Requirements / acceptance criteria checked
- Plan decisions checked
- Constitution principles checked (or "skipped — template")
- Findings by gap type (missing / partial / contradicts / unrequested)
- Findings by severity

### 7. Append Convergence Tasks (or report converged)

**If there are one or more actionable findings** (`tasks_appended` outcome):

Append to the **end** of `tasks.md`, per the append contract:

1. Scan all existing task IDs; let `M` be the maximum. Determine the next phase number `N`
   (highest existing phase + 1).
2. Write a single new section header `## Phase N: Convergence`.
3. Emit one checklist item per actionable finding, ordered CRITICAL/HIGH first, assigning
   zero-padded IDs `T{M+1:03d}, T{M+2:03d}, …`:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T042 <imperative description> per <source-ref> (<gap-type>)
   ```

   `<source-ref>` traces the task to its origin: e.g. `FR-003`, `SC-002`,
   `US1/AC2`, `plan: storage decision`, `Constitution II`.

   `<gap-type>` is one of `missing`, `partial`, `contradicts`, `unrequested`.

   Constitution-violation tasks MUST be emitted first and described as
   `CRITICAL`.
4. Never reuse or renumber existing IDs. If a prior Convergence phase exists, add a new,
   separately-numbered one below it — do not touch the old one.

**If there are no actionable findings** (`converged` outcome):

- Do **not** modify `tasks.md` at all — no empty phase header.
- Report: **"✅ Converged — the implementation satisfies the spec, plan, and tasks."**
- Include the summary counts of what was checked.

### 8. Provide Next Actions (Handoff)

- On `tasks_appended`: state how many tasks were appended under which phase, and recommend
  running `speckit-implement` to complete them; note that a follow-up converge
  run will find fewer or no remaining items.
- On `converged`: recommend proceeding to review / opening a PR. No further implement pass
  is needed for this feature's specified scope.
